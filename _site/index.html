<p>The Self-Improvement Club was a rather spontaneous idea. The idea is that everyone involved chooses a goal they would like to meet over 3 months and pledges their commitment. If no progress has been made, the perpetrator is required to chip into a self improvement pool which can be used to finance future three month sprints.</p>

<p>I have been taking conversationally intensive Spanish classes through a great program <a href="http://www.tallerlatino.org/">El Taller</a>. Although I have made considerable progress, it's becoming increasingly obvious that the only true way to learn another language is via immersion. My level of Spanish is reaching its non-immersion saturation point.</p>

<p>Things I did in 2012:</p>

<ul>
<li>Became highly proficient several languages</li>
<li>Traveled to Hawaii</li>
<li>Witnessed an acquisition first-hand</li>
<li>Helped build an amazing product that lots of people use</li>
</ul>


<p>2012 was a huge year for me. It laid the foundation for my career in NYC and was a huge turning point in my life. At the start of 2011 I wasn't completely convinced that the startup/entrepreneurial/business world would appeal to me. Today I am convinced that it's truly a profession and ecosphere I want to be a part of.</p>

<p>I'd like to end this post with a short rant I wrote a while back about reorganization.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="mako"><span class="x">A cluttered life is a confused one. Being able to organize what’s most important to you, physically or emotionally, helps bring order and clarity to yourself. I regularly find that working in a clean space positively effects my creative process. Devoid of distractions I’m capable of focusing directly on the task before me rather than around me. In other words I don’t become a victim of my need to clean up my shit.</span>

<span class="x">To me, reorganization is uplifting. Seeing my potential for cleanliness, brings a smile to my face. From the most simple example of cleaning my room to a more complex reflection on my personal identity, reorganization has helped me become who I am. I simply wish more people were capable of looking backwards a week, a month, a year, ten years, etc.. and come to the conclusion of- “Damn, I totally handled that situation poorly.”</span>
