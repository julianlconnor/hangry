            <div class="post-date">01.27.13</div>
            <div class="post-content"><p>At <a href="https://venmo.com">Venmo</a> we use <a href="tornadoweb.org">Tornado</a> to power our API and async requests. Recently I found myself having to write a proxy using Tornado and ran into some frustrating issues involving small HTTP nuances that other libraries such as <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/">Requests</a> handle for you.</p>

<h2>Gotcha #1</h2>

<p>Can you see what's wrong with this snippet?</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python"><span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">http_client</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fetch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="p">,</span>
                         <span class="n">callback</span><span class="p">,</span>
                         <span class="n">method</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;GET&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="c"># POST, PUT, DELETE, etc..</span>
                         <span class="n">headers</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">headers</span><span class="p">,</span>
                         <span class="n">body</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>I looked at this for several hours. Turns out that <code>body</code> can not be <code>None</code> even if it's a <code>GET</code> request (requests with no body). Tornado expects an empty string even though the documentation lists <code>body</code> as a keyword argument that will default to <code>None</code>.</p>

<h2>Gotcha #2</h2>

<p>Tornado does not encode arguments for you. I.e., you need to urlencode arguments and append them to either the query string or body depending on the type of request (<code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, etc..)</p>

<p>Here's how I handled this situation:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python"><span class="c">## Inside of my request handler.</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">urllib</span>

<span class="n">url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;http://www.someapi.com&quot;</span>
<span class="n">body</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="c"># Per the previous gotcha</span>
<span class="n">encoded_params</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">urllib</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">urlencode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">method</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&quot;GET&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">url</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="s">&quot;?&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">encoded_params</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">body</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">encoded_params</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Annoying but not the end of the world.</p>

<h2>Gotcha #3</h2>

<p>There's still one more issue regarding our previous gotcha. We still need to properly set our headers.</p>

<p>The above snippet now becomes:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">urllib</span>

<span class="n">url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;http://www.someapi.com&quot;</span>
<span class="n">body</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="c"># Per the previous gotcha</span>
<span class="n">headers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="n">encoded_params</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">urllib</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">urlencode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">method</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&quot;GET&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">url</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="s">&quot;?&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">params_str</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">body</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">params_str</span>
    <span class="n">headers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s">&#39;Content-Type&#39;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#39;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>And there you go, 3 silly caveats that I spent a fair amount of time debugging. Running into issues like this brings light to the dependence software engineers have on abstractions and how important it is to understand the layers beneath.</p>

            <div class="post-content"><p>In this tutorial I am going to show you how to use <a href="https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano">Capistrano</a> to deploy your Jekyll blog to an AWS instance (or any server for that matter). I realized that I wanted full control of my blog (none of this CMS nonsense) and decided that a flow where I could edit posts locally, push them to github, and then use Capistrano to deploy these changes to the "<code>cloud</code>" would be pretty cool.. so I did it. ;)</p>

<p>In this tutorial I will cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>Installing Capistrano</li>
<li>Configuring Capistrano</li>
<li>Deploying Your Blog via Capistrano</li>
</ul>


<p>Things I will not cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>Serving your site via nginx / apache.</li>
<li>Configuring Jekyll</li>
</ul>


<p>As stated in the <a href="https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano">Capistrano</a> docs, Capistrano (aka Cap) is a tool written in Ruby to help manage the deployment of webapps. With this said, everything I'm going to note in this tutorial can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki">Capistrano Wiki</a>.</p>

<p>Firstly, we'll want to install Capistrano and navigate to our project.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">gem install capistrano
<span class="nb">cd </span>PATH_TO_YOUR_PROJECT
</code></pre></div>


<p>If you use <a href="https://rvm.io/">RVM</a>, you will want to make sure you're using the version of Ruby you'd like to use and you're currently using the proper gemset.</p>

<p>Now that we're inside of our project, let's capify it by typing <code>capify .</code>.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">capify .
<span class="o">[</span>add<span class="o">]</span> writing <span class="s1">&#39;./Capfile&#39;</span>
<span class="o">[</span>add<span class="o">]</span> making directory <span class="s1">&#39;./config&#39;</span>
<span class="o">[</span>add<span class="o">]</span> writing <span class="s1">&#39;./config/deploy.rb&#39;</span>
<span class="o">[</span><span class="k">done</span><span class="o">]</span> capified!
</code></pre></div>


<p>As we can see, this command generated two files (<code>Capfile</code>, <code>config/deploy.rb</code>) and a directory (config). The <code>Capfile</code> is the main file that capistrano automatically loads and in our case it is very minimal. All it does in this scenario is load the <code>config/deploy.rb</code> file. The <code>deploy.rb</code> file contains all the contents that are pertinent to this tutorial.</p>

<p>Let's look at the contents of <code>config/deploy.rb</code>.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">:application</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;hangry&quot;</span> <span class="c1"># Sets the name of our application, we could have more than one blog for example.</span>
<span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">:repository</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="s2">&quot;git@github.com:muffs/hangry.git&quot;</span> <span class="c1"># Where can Capistrano find your application on github?</span>

<span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">:scm</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:git</span> <span class="c1"># What type of version control do you use? This could also be `git`, `mercurial`, `subversion`, etc..</span>
<span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">:deploy_to</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/home/ubuntu/blog&quot;</span> <span class="c1"># Where on your server do you want to place your project?</span>
<span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">:user</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ubuntu&quot;</span> <span class="c1"># What user should Capistrano SSH as?</span>

<span class="n">role</span> <span class="ss">:blog</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;12.12.12.12&quot;</span> <span class="c1"># Where is your server? lol</span>

<span class="n">ssh_options</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:forward_agent</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kp">true</span> <span class="c1"># This tells Capistrano to use your local keys for github rather than keys found on the server.</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Once we're all set with your <code>deploy.rb</code> file, we need to run two commands in our shell.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">cap deploy:setup
cap deploy
</code></pre></div>


<p><code>cap deploy:setup</code> quite literally sets up the directories used for deployment. Capistrano manages deployments in an interesting way by simply changing symlinks to allow for easy versioning. A great explanation of the directory structure can be found <a href="https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki/2.x-from-the-beginning">here</a>. <code>cap deploy</code> is the command that: accesses github, clones your target repository, and then moves the <code>current</code> symlink to point to your most recent version. Pretty slick process.</p>

<p>Now you should be all set, from here you can make changes to your blog on your local machine, push those changes to github, and use <code>cap deploy</code> to have your changes properly represented on your server.</p>

<p>The Self-Improvement Club was a rather spontaneous idea. The idea is that everyone involved chooses a goal they would like to meet over 3 months and pledges their commitment. If no progress has been made, the perpetrator is required to chip into a self improvement pool which can be used to finance future three month sprints.</p>

<p>I have been taking conversationally intensive Spanish classes through a great program <a href="http://www.tallerlatino.org/">El Taller</a>. Although I have made considerable progress, it's becoming increasingly obvious that the only true way to learn another language is via immersion. My level of Spanish is reaching its non-immersion saturation point and it's a tad bit depressing. I'm definitely going to stick with it and see where the next few months take me.</p>

<p>With that said, I didn't have much of a goal for this post other than to vent my thoughts.</p>

<p>Things I did in 2012:</p>

<ul>
<li>Became highly proficient several languages</li>
<li>Traveled to Hawaii</li>
<li>Witnessed an acquisition first-hand</li>
<li>Helped build an amazing product that lots of people use</li>
</ul>


<p>2012 was a huge year for me. It laid the foundation for my career in NYC and was a huge turning point in my life. At the start of 2011 I wasn't completely convinced that the startup/entrepreneurial/business world would appeal to me. Today I am convinced that it's truly a profession and ecosphere I want to be a part of.</p>

<p>I'd like to end this post with a short rant I wrote a while back about reorganization.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="mako"><span class="x">A cluttered life is a confused one. Being able to organize what’s most important to you, physically or emotionally, helps bring order and clarity to yourself. I regularly find that working in a clean space positively effects my creative process. Devoid of distractions I’m capable of focusing directly on the task before me rather than around me. In other words I don’t become a victim of my need to clean up my shit.</span>

<span class="x">To me, reorganization is uplifting. Seeing my potential for cleanliness, brings a smile to my face. From the most simple example of cleaning my room to a more complex reflection on my personal identity, reorganization has helped me become who I am. I simply wish more people were capable of looking backwards a week, a month, a year, ten years, etc.. and come to the conclusion of- “Damn, I totally handled that situation poorly.”</span>
