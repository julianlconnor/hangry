    <div class="post-content"><p>When we realized we shouldn't be in a bar- we were in a bar.</p>

<p>The Self-Improvement Club was a rather spontaneous idea. The idea is that everyone involved chooses a goal they would like to meet over 3 months and pledges their commitment. If no progress has been made, the perpetrator is required to chip into a self improvement pool which can be used to finance future three month sprints.</p>

<p>I have been taking conversationally intensive Spanish classes through a great program <a href="http://www.tallerlatino.org/">El Taller</a>. Although I have made considerable progress, it's becoming increasingly obvious that the only true way to learn another language is via immersion. My level of Spanish is reaching its non-immersion saturation point and it's a tad bit depressing. I'm definitely going to stick with it and see where the next few months take me.</p>

<p>With that said, I didn't have much of a goal for this post other than to vent my thoughts.</p>
