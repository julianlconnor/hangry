title: Why I Collect Records
---
I've been asked this question several times within the last couple of weeks thus I'll address it here.

I collect records mostly because mp3s feel ethereal; they come and go as my tastes change and there is no musical equivalent of diaries to memories. The closest solution I've come up with is my OCD organization of playlists (anyone who has seen my iTunes library can attest to this) but this is still not enough. I've now turned to record collecting as another layer of reminiscense I need to properly recollect and obsess my over my ever growing library.

A nice side effect of my new hobbie is that it helps support the artists I've ripped albums from in the past.


It's funny though because I still don't have a record player haha.
