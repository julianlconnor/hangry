New years day is a great time to reflect.

Things I did in 2012:
    * Became highly proficient several languages
    * Traveled to Hawaii
    * Witnessed an acquisition first-hand
    * Helped build an amazing product that lots of people use

2012 was a huge year for me. It laid the foundation for my career in NYC and was a huge turning point in my life. At the start of 2011 I wasn't completely convinced that the startup/entrepreneurial/business world would appeal to me. Today I am convinced that it's truly a profession and ecosphere I want to be a part of.

I'd like to end this post with a short rant I wrote a while back about reorganization.

{% highlight mako %}
A cluttered life is a confused one. Being able to organize what’s most important to you, physically or emotionally, helps bring order and clarity to yourself. I regularly find that working in a clean space positively effects my creative process. Devoid of distractions I’m capable of focusing directly on the task before me rather than around me. In other words I don’t become a victim of my need to clean up my shit.

To me, reorganization is uplifting. Seeing my potential for cleanliness, brings a smile to my face. From the most simple example of cleaning my room to a more complex reflection on my personal identity, reorganization has helped me become who I am. I simply wish more people were capable of looking backwards a week, a month, a year, ten years, etc.. and come to the conclusion of- “Damn, I totally handled that situation poorly.”
